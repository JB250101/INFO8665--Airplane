# INFO8665--Airplane
Predicting flight patterns for DSS

## Project Description
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict airplane fare prices based on factors like airline, journey date, source, destination, and total stops. The project is developed collaboratively using **GitHub** and **Azure Boards** for effective project management and collaboration.

## **Goals**
- Develop a robust fare prediction model with optimized performance.
- Implement CI/CD workflows for smooth integration and deployment.
- Collaborate efficiently using Azure Boards and GitHub workflows.

## **Project Workflow Structure**
### **Branching Strategy**
- Each feature or task is handled under separate **sprint branches** following a predefined branching structure:
  - `main`: Stable code ready for deployment.
  - `sprint/[sprint-number]`: Contains work done under specific sprints.
  - Development starts with branching from `main` and ends with merging the work back through a **pull request**.
  - The professor will review pull requests before merging them into `main`.

---

### **Pull Request Workflow**
1. Create a new branch for each sprint using the naming convention: `sprint/[task-id]`.
2. Implement the task in the respective branch.
3. Create a pull request with proper description and linked Azure Board tasks.
4. The professor reviews the pull request.
5. If approved, the branch is merged into `main`.

## **Environment Setup**
To replicate the development environment:
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JB250101/INFO8665--Airplane.git
   cd INFO8665--Airplane



## Directory Structure

# INFO8665--AIRPLANE

### Project and environment setup

1. Move to project directory "INFO8665" where you have cloned the project
2. Create virtual environment with name **"airplanevenve"**
    - Make sure ```python --version``` is set to **12.3.6** in your system
    - ```python -m venv airplanevenve```
3. Activate environment
    - ```.\airplanevenve\Scripts\Activate.ps1```
    - In case you are using visual studio code, Choose the environment from menu as active environment
4. Install packages mentioned in **"requirements.txt"**
    - ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Select **"airplanevenve"** environment in your IDE
6. Create folder named **"dataset"** in your project directory
7. Move all files downloaded from Kaggle dataset in the "Dataset" Directory


### Update Requirements.txt file once installing new packages

```pip freeze > requirements.txt```

    
    **data/**:
    - This directory contains the dataset(s) required for analysis.
    - Place any CSV, JSON, or other data files within this directory.

    **.gitignore**:
    - A configuration file used to exclude certain files and directories from being tracked by Git. 
    - Common exclusions include the `airplanevenv/` directory, temporary files, and large datasets.

    **airplane.ipynb**:
    - The main Jupyter Notebook where data analysis, preprocessing, and model training are performed.
    - Open this using Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code to explore the project.

    **README.md**:
    - This project documentation file explains the structure, setup instructions, and project details.

    **docs**:
    - This directory contains all the html pages, document report for every sprints

2. **Azure DevOps Integration:**
    Follow Azure Boards integration setup guidelines as outlined in [Azure Boards Link](https://dev.azure.com/Jburman0180/Airplane%20Fare%20Price/).
